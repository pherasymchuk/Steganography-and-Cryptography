summary: "<p>You can use encryption to send secret messages, but if you want to be\
  \ even more subtle, you can hide them in plain sight: in an image. This kind of\
  \ encryption is called steganography. The message will be hiding in a picture on\
  \ some web site, and only those who know will understand it. For maximum security,\
  \ the message itself can be encrypted, as well.</p><br/><br/>Learn more at <a href=\"\
